                "text" : "It's one thing to be looking for an inexpensive guitar, but who doesn't want the best bang for your buck? Being on a limited budget, I chose this guitar simply for its price tag and for the sake of saying I had a Gibson electric guitar. Expecting it to be at least equal to my Fender Squier, which the price package is just $50 more than this Gibson's original price of $149.99, I was disappointed. Also working in retail selling these, we had more than I would like to have expected returned due to defects, though admittedly, a few were just a matter of tweaking the guitar itself by raising the height of the strings. Unfortunately with the Gibson, you cannot raise strings individually as you can with the Fender's, so if one string is buzzing due to it being too low and you adjust it, you adjust all the strings--not a major issue, but just annoying. One thing that was better for me about the Gibson is that the strings were slightly spaced out more than the Fender's, so my fingers wouldn't always interfere with the strings to cause more buzzing or the suffering of a chord. Another feature that the Squier has that the Maestro does not is a synchronous tremolo bridge, which those of you familiar with Guitar Hero, is your whammy bar. It's not something I personally use, but it might be something cool to play around with. The quality of sound goes to the Fender Squier, mostly because it offers more. It has 3 single-coil pickups (Volume & 2 for Tone) to the Gibson's 2 (Volume & one Tone). The Fender also has a 5-way switch expanding from Bass to Treble, so a player can experiment more with the sounds more internally--the Gibson does not. The amp supplied by Gibson, which I will mention later, limits the player's ability to experiment with the sound effects once again, but externally. Since getting the Gibson, I play it only with the Squier amp that Fender included with its package, though still, I do not play it as much as the Fender. Overall, the Fender guitar sounds better than the Maestro's, but the Maestro does win out in Overdrive mode, as it sounds better and cleaner.What else is in the box: extra set of strings, small amp, instructional DVD, picks, and a strap. The strings are ok, but I prefer some heavier ones. The picks are too thick for me, but that's a personal preference issue. The DVD is short and ok, but only for beginners. It does not teach you any actual songs as examples, though. One issue with this package is the amp. It's about the size of a small, petite women's purse. The sound is just not acceptable to me, and does not give a beginner--or anyone--an accurate taste of the potential music that this guitar can produce. I worry that people will return this once they hear how poorly it sounds, thinking it's the guitar's fault when it's the amp's. The size of the speaker is maybe 3 inches in diameter. It's only a 5 watt amp and can either be powered by a DC adapter or a 9V battery. Don't use a 9V battery. I had some issues with the battery, as the longest I got it to work was 2 minutes--not even an entire song! And yes, I did try other batteries, but with no success. The amp offers an On/Off/Overdrive switch, a Volume dial, a Treble dial, and inputs for your cable and headphones. I would've liked a Bass dial added as well, but I think they didn't include it because the amp is so low-powered, it might not live long with it. The Fender package, however, has a 10-watt amp with a 6 inch speaker, which of course makes it noticeably larger and produces much better sound. Though not \"powerful\" either, it's still good enough to rock a room in a house and get the \"TURN IT DOWN!!\" complaints from anyone else who lives with you. The Fender amp has all the other adjustment features as the Gibson one, but has more! It adds Gain and Bass dials. It has a separate Overdrive button, which just activates the adjustable Gain dial so you can go from soft rock to heavy metal if you want. These dials are cool, especially to beginners, because you can mix a bunch of different settings to create different sound effects--it gives you the opportunity to learn and experiment more!So overall, you may be getting an inexpensive guitar, but if you're expecting Gibson quality, I've played much better. The only thing \"Gibson\" about it is its design. Though you'd have to spend much more money on a decent Gibson to know the true essence of their greatness, this model is cheaply priced at $149.99. I'd recommend spending the extra $50 to get the Fender Starcaster package they sell on Amazon for $199.99, and I have seen them go on sale at other retail stores. You get everything the Gibson one offers plus a guitar stand, a digital tuner, and more features. You get much more \"bang for your buck.\" This Gibson is a well made guitar for beginners in and of itself, but it is STRICTLY for beginners. It truly limits your capabilities, and if you were to expand and grow with playing the guitar, you will eventually have to upgrade the amp and this guitar itself. Should you decide to advance, the Fender Starcaster will grow more with you when you upgrade to a new amp. Simply put, the Fender Starcaster package offers a more and better opportunity to grow and experiment for beginners than this Gibson guitar package. The extra money is well worth the investment. They come in different colors, but here's one of the Fender packages:Fender Starcaster Strat Pack Electric Guitar with Amp and Accessories - Midnight Blue"

Overall finish is well done, though on mine there's some noticeable imperfections in the finish and the binding around the neck and nut. A few frets high up the neck were sharp on the edges and needed to be filed down. Also would have liked the F-holes to be finished. Mine came with a few cosmetic blemishes but luckily I got it for a discount.- Hardware: 8 out of 10. The pick guard and tailpiece are good quality. The tuners hold a tune but are average in quality.- Tone: 9 out of 10. Very good tone with proper setup. Very clear sounding with good sustain. Ensure you properly adjust the saddle position before playing for correct intonation- Case: 10 out of 10. Case that comes with it is excellent and top quality"

Tight fit + thin padding = nervous traveling musician.-The front pockets are aesthetically innovative in design, but impractical in use. 8x11 books will not fit vertically (and fit rather poorly horizontally). I also constantly carry around a metronome, nail maintenance pouch, and A-frame support, none of which fit very well in the slim pockets.Years of lugging around a National & heavy acoustic cases have left my back & neck in dire need of good gig bags. I've bought quality products from the Musician's Friend brand before, but I'm returning this one & splurging on the Road Runner. I'm guessing this case would serve best those with classicals under $700."

I never record with it, but it has been through the thousands of hours of practice sessions I've used it for and it delivers the same sound every time. Many times it has solved a sound problem BECAUSE of it's cheap nature. Sometimes cheap is what you need. If your starting out and are short of $$ this pedal is a must buy, if you need a back up this pedal is again a must. Arion has made a career of satisfying the need I just described. I own an ARION distortion and a octave, and many-a time they are exactly what is required for a certain sound. The price is right. Expand your sound. You can't really go wrong if you know what to expect from a pedal at this price point."

I am a music major, I teach at a public school, and I perform frequently; needless to say, my metronome is one of my most important possessions.I bought this metronome because I was frustrated with the cheaper digital metronomes--their beep is both annoying and difficult to hear over a wind instrument. I borrowed my roommates nice wooden wittner before ordering my own; it was both accurate at audible. So, overtaken with nostalgia and faith in old technology, I purchased a plastic model from Amazon. Came on time, nicely packaged, etc. However, when I started the pendulum for the first time, I was shocked by the definite lilt between beats. To be honest, I am not sure if a \"non-musician\" would be able to hear it. Nevertheless, all of my fellow music-student friends wrinkled their noses after just six beats of my shiny new metronome. It seems that if the metronome is not placed on a perfectly level surface, it will not function properly.To give the device a fair trial, I ran it next to my old digital Korg metronome. The pair were out of sync in seconds flat.I gave this two stars because, well, it's kind of cool. It's clearly constructed well and appears to be durable. Despite this, however, a faulty metronome is to a musician like a warped level to a carpenter: useless! Needless to say, I will be mailing mine back in the next couple of days."

Ive had this mic almost 2 years and i love it. very easy to hook up just plug it in, no discs, none of that extra stuff. I take alot of pride in my sound seeing that hip hop is always ridiculed and there are those who think we dont take it serious but i've seen and will continue to see so much success ... partly because i am awesome... but really i give all credit to my MXL. This mic has been the foundation of all the projects ive created. its never let me down, and i will continue to use it until it blows up. if your on a 100-200 dollar budget and you want something that'll last and be respected please pick this mic up. I stand by MXL. i stand by my 006 USB condenser mic and i will never let it go. its the first mic i ever owned. might be the only one. i dont record with pure silence in the background and i dont do podcasts and the like, but i do make music and i lay vocals and this mic is the TRUTH!!! listen for yourself...

                "text" : "On paper, this is a neat mic -- it truly does have a high-quality condenser element that records vocals with a rich, warm sound and works seamlessly via USB (though it should really call itself something more descriptive than \"USB Audio Codec\" to the connected computer). But as other reviewers have said, the MXL 006 USB has a problem with \"self-noise,\" an ineradicable background noise, and combined with a few other design and packaging problems this made it a poor choice for me.The noise problems are actually several different sub-problems. First, the mic is very \"hot\" and hypersensitive, a design better suited to a studio environment than home use -- it takes a lot of work to quiet the mic down in a room that isn't acoustically deadened to studio standards. The dinky included tripod stand provides nearly no acoustic isolation, and picks up huge amounts of desk noise and hum from nearby electronics; the mic itself is not well isolated against handling noise or vibration. It's also very tippy and flimsy, and does a bad job holding the mic in place. This means that if you're using this for podcast recording, e.g., you'll want to get a shockmount and a boom mic stand immediately; and it's not a good choice for portable/field recording both because of this and because of the manufacturer's stern warnings inside the box about how fragile its condenser element apparently is.And despite its mild cardioid pickup pattern screening out some noise from the back (NB: it's a side-address configuration, which isn't obvious from the product listing), the mic actually picks up tons of background and room noise. Even close-miked for vocals and using the included windscreen/filter, a nearby computer keyboard or paper-shuffling can be heard easily -- you can even hear the speaker fidgeting, shifting in their clothes, and far too much chest noise. Sensitivity is nice, of course, but this mic does a terrible job rejecting unwanted noise and focusing on a single source.And once you work around all this, there's still a background hum, a self-noise which the mic keeps making under all circumstances rather than ever recording just \"silence\"/room tone. It's not loud, but it's always there, and it's a deal-breaker for me. Along with a couple other small problems (like the lack of headphone jack for monitoring) this is just too many noise problems for a simple USB mic to have. Although it's built on strong fundamentals, compared to the field recording-friendliness and durability ofAudio Technica's USB dynamic micsor the simplicity of theBlue Snowballthis MXL model just seems much too fiddly and noisy and finicky to recommend."

As I said, incredibly sensitive - never ran into that issue with my previous headset mic.It also captures more voice bass than real life, so you'll need to do some EQ in a program like Audacity to get proper sound.

But when I decided to go pro with my humor blog and as an added bonus for my readers, offer an audio mp3 of me reading each post aloud, I realized real quick that not just anything will do.Three years ago, I developed a cyst on one of my vocal cords. We didn't get to it fast enough and when it burst, it managed to permanent damage my voice when a piece of the left cord went AWOL; it's been MIA ever since. Seeing how my vocal cords cannot ever completely close, I constantly sound hoarse; as if I have a cold. Some days are worse than others. I needed a microphone that could compensate for this as well as my simplistic technical skills and short attention span. A great guy down at The Guitar Center recommended this microphone to me.I read the owner's manual immediately. It was the least I could do after all of the goodies Marshall included (cool case, desk stand, etc). Amongst the advice, they mentioned how dropping the microphone or even bumping it can damage it enough to cause what I see other reviewers tend to complain about. It's always easier to blame to manufacturer than admit you're a klutz, I suppose. But at the same time, the reviewers very well could've taken perfect care of the microphone as instructed-- but the 18 year old playing with it at the store it came from didn't. Who knows.All I know is this. I followed the instructions and suggestions (i.e. purchasing a pop filter, placing the mic in the middle of the room, and everything else) and within seconds of USBing it into my PC, it was ready. My voice sounds ridiculously damaged as it should. And I'm as happy as a lark."

There are points where there will only be narration, and no music or background audio.Although it sounds pretty good for a USB mic, in that it gives a rich, faithful reproduction, there is a noticeable pitch generated by the microphone itself. This self-noise is audible during quiet moments or even when speech is recorded, if you listen carefully. On the plus side, it does come with a nifty case, desktop tripod and has hardware gain control with three settings. It worked right out of the box with my Mac, so no problems in the compatibility department.I was poking around to make myself feel better about buying this microphone over the popular Samson C01U and Snowball, and came across a review of all of these microphones, including the new Rode Podcaster, pitted against each other. The reviewer noted a distinct B-natural pitch from the MXLUSB.006, though it did have less self-noise than the Samson. Check out the review at Emusician, search google for Samson, MXL, Podcaster and you should find it.Wish I saw that review before I bought the MXL, since I experienced the same thing. Though the MXL has a rich sound, the noise is unacceptable for my application and I'll be returning it.Although USB mics are notorious for noticeable self-noise, I went ahead and got the Rode Podcaster, and have not noticed any significant self-noise.If a faint high-pitched noise is not a big deal to you, this is a pretty good condenser microphone. I would be all over it if it weren't for the fact that I need a really quiet mic."

                "text" : "I've been a home recordist for about 30 years. I've owned a variety of mics, from old Crown PZMs to higher-end Audio Technicas and a few exotic Germans. These days, I don't do as much recording as I did when I had dreams of becoming the next Nils Lofgren, but I occasionally like to doodle with music. These days, I'm a great believer in the ease and rock steady performance of Garageband on the Mac. I honestly much prefer working with it, rather than many \"better\" programs out there. It's just so solid on the mac. The reason for this long intro is just to introduce my approach to recording. I want stuff that works, and that works with little muss or fuss. When I sold of my last AT stereo mic and E-MU 4040 preamp, I thought I was done with wrestling with wires and recording. Well, I caught the bug again lately and felt guilty about ridding myself of all my equipment. But I wanted ease and convenience and I started researching the USB mics out there. I listened to about every sample available, and I was fairly sure the MXL mic were worth investigating further. They have a rich, full-bodied sound which I like. They also seemed to suffer less from ambient noise than the Snowball and Sansom mics. The MXL sounded a little darker, which some might think meant a bit deader, but I was sure that wouldn't be the case when it came down to recording. And I was right. First of all, the .006 works flawlessly. I plugged it it. My mac recognized it and I was up and rolling without latency. Occasionally you'll get hit with latency in Garageband -- but that usually just requires a restart. Then it's gone. The MXL was up and running in less than a minute. No problem getting enough power from my USB port, something I even had problems with with an old Belkin USB mic adapter. No, the MXL worked great. It's fairly well made, the only \"suspect\" component being the gain switch, which is pretty inexpensive and felt a little unsure. But it works fine, so I wasn't too worried about it. Plus, look at the price of this mic. The sound? Well, I would rate it an 8.75, which I think is quite flattering. I was able to mic myself singing with my guitar amp about 8 feet way and achieve a nice mix. And it recorded my 5-year old's faint, faint whisper (too shy to talk into the mic) perfectly. Stunningly, actually. So this mic is actually capable of great detail and sensitivity when your hitting it within its working range. Not dead sounding at all. I really like it's balance and design which make for quick and easily recordings without a whole lot of tweaking. As far as vocals, my teenage daughter voice sounded fantastic. Very nice with female vocals. I really like my \"voiceover\" sound with this mic. Rich and fully, but not over bloated. As far as my singing, it handles dynamics great and, as I said, it will handle a whisper to a shout without blinking. It's not a 100% 3-dimensional and rounded like a great Neuman Old Blues Eyes mic, but it's excellent for male vocals when doing home recording. I think I got my best take (of a male vocal) when I was cranking up my delivery a bit. A little R&B shouting, and it was as good as any mic I've played with for a long time. So consider that my take of it's vocal abilties for the male voice. It's less a Leonard Cohen mic and more of a John Lennon mic. And, as I said, I really think it shines with female vocals. I didn't hear the whine as described by the other reviewer. But my recording room wasn't dead silent and the noisest thing I heard was the fan from my mac. I think you're more likely to be bugged by uncontrolled sound in your environment than any noise inherent to the mic -- if there is any. I wrote MXL and they said poor power supplies and likely user error is probably behind the claimed noise. I just know, recording music, that you just aren't going the hear it in the mix even if it does exist. I did some dead silent voiceoever again tonight, and I still didn't hear a whine. So overall, I'm very happy to recommend this mic. Make sure you get a pop screen, it helped alot. I really, really like this mic for both its performance and especially its fantastic convenience. If you don't feel like dealing with the time (and expense) of rigging up a mic and preamp and just want to \"plug and play\", well, I don't think you can make a better choice than his MXL .006 mic or one in its USB line. And I look forward to hearing more of the mics in their USB line."

Audacity is what I use to record. I plugged in the microphone, and Windows installed all the drivers with no issues whatsoever. I did a couple of test tracks with different settings. I also tried different distances from the microphone and treated the room I was in. The sound was tinny. It really sounded awful. If you Google Tinny sound MXL USB OO6, you'll get some other reviews that state the same issue. I wish I had found those prior to the purchase. I returned it the very next day. Now I am back to square one. I would welcome anyone's knowledgeable feedback. I need a good microphone I can use to record a series of audio books and podcasts. My budget is $350 and below. I am running Windows 7 as referenced prior, and do not have a preference of USB or traditional. I am shying away from Condensers because they pick up too much sound. However, if there is a way to truly offset the Condenser's sensitivity then by all means please let me know? Thank you so much!"

It is very easily broken so I was very disappointed. I asked for a refund the very next day. I ended up buying the Audio Technica AT 2035 & the Studio Projects C1 microphone which are both very very well built. I really love them especially the Audio Technica. I also have the Audio Technica headset as well. Great quality. I'm glad that I decided to ask for a refund. Save your money if you want a truely good mic. I bought mine for my work because I have my own in-home studio so the MXL was not acceptable quality at all for business purposes. A good mic should last a couple of yrs this one you will be lucky if it lasts 24 hrs"

Also, the power supply is internal, so there's no \"wall wart,\" unlike some competitors. Digital FX work fine for vocals but I could see how they could be a bit cheesy with some instruments.

For example, when I want a deep sound I use Evans hydraulic heads on my toms, but when I want a small jazz kit sound I switch to Remo Fiberskyns. Having this key kit takes the drudgery out of frequent head changes.Here is what I use in addition to the key kit:- Campbell Hausfeld DG110400CD Mini Compact Drill with Keyless Chuck (ASIN DG110400CD). This is a compact and inexpensive drill that does not have much power or torque, so it is not going to strip your lugs or hurt the finish.- Rhythm Tech Memo Key (ASIN B0002E2EOE) to allow you to quickly get your heads in perfect tuning once you have done an initial tuning and have written down the settings. You can also use the Evans Torque tuning key (ASIN B0002D0HZI). Either of those will work fine.Thus armed with these tools head changing becomes easy. If you do not routinely change heads you might find the above tools to still be invaluable because drum heads can make a dramatic difference in how a kit sounds, and many of the most popular heads come in pre-packs that are attractively priced. The combination of ease and price will allow you to experiment. It's a lot less expensive than multiple sets of drums, especially if you play more than one genre of music."

                "text" : "This cymbal is like a fine wine - it starts life with some imprinted characteristics, then, as it ages, evolves into a complex nectar. Mine started out bone dry. In fact, it was so dry that I had a three rivet cluster installed. At that point I used it as a left-side-ride, paired with myZildjian K Custom 21-Inch Special Dry Ride Cymbaland it was a perfect match.As the years went by (I acquired it in 2004) I noticed more over- and undertones emanating from it, and eventually removed the rivets (temporarily because at one point I realized that I missed the sizzle.)From the time I first received it until now, despite the transformation, this remains a cymbal that is limited in musical situations in which it works well: light, acoustic ensembles. It is a perfect left side ride for drummers in piano trios playing jazz, and could probably work in other light genres. In fact, with or without rivets, it would be the perfect main ride in tiny venues such as coffee houses.Out of the box this cymbal looks like it was just dug up after being buried for hundreds of years. It has no tonal grooves lathed into it, and it has an umbrella profile, which probably accounts for the complexities as it gets played in.If you want to hasten the play-in process to have this cymbal yield some of its inherent complexities sooner than later, try the mallet roll trick. This entails taking a pair of mallets (I use theZildjian SDMJO John Riley Double Stick/Mallet Pair) and roll them around the cymbal for 20 minutes per day for a week or so. Start at the outside edge and work your way towards the bell, going around the circumference of the cymbal. This little trick also tames down new cymbals that are a little too wild and trashy, such as theZildjian K Custom K0964 22-Inch Dark Complex Ride Ride Cymbal.This particular model has relatively narrow applications, but if you are playing in an acoustic group it's a perfect ride. Also, if you are using Zildjian's Special Dry or Light Dry series, it will match them sonically."

This mic was my choice because of my past experience with Nady products and the price. It has a full clear sound with very high gain. What I actually ended up doing was using it as my Hi Hat mic and using the AKG i had over the ride with fantastic results. The only thing I can say is the mic does not have a low end roll off switch which would make it it top notch, but that was easy to remedy by just using a parametric EQ to gain the results I wanted. 2 thumbs up for the Nady condensor. Just the price alone makes it worth buying"

I was at Best Buy buying some DVD tapes, and long behold a full music shop!!Guitars, Amps, Drums, etc...like being at Guitar Center but without all the IDIOTS who work at GC. I was comparing speakers and the QSC HPR122i powered speakers caught my eye. I asked the salesman if I could hear them and I was blown away on how raw and organic these sounded!! They had a pair of 15's JBL next to these and 15's Mackie along side the JBL's so I compared the sound of all three and the Macks and JBL's never came close in sound. These QSC's 12's blew the other two away!!! I bought them on the spot and not to mention the very friendly service and knowledgeable salesman.For now I'llkeep my 10's, but wll keep my eyes open for any new cones.QSC rocks the earth!!!!!!!"

The tracking was very neurotic and non-committal. This wouldn't have been an issue if I didn't lend out my trusty Sabine ZIP-700 (..and it was dropped for the last time).Conclusion, if you're tuning up in the dark backstage with no light source on your Sadowsky 5 string, forget it.

The customer service folks at Korg were very nice and sent a replacement out right away, no charge. But when I went to test it out, it didn't work, either. Same problem. I began to wonder if I was doing something wrong. I placed my tuner right next to the new one, and it worked fine, as always. So I called Korg again, told them the problem, again, and waited for the replacement. Luckily when it arrived, it worked great. So that is why I'm only giving this tuner three stars. The unit itself works very well with my acoustic or electric guitar. But having to get two replacement tuners before I received one that worked was a bit of a hassle, although the people at Korg were very good about mailing me out another one very quickly."

With my acoustic, the accuracy seems to drop slightly (perhaps due to lesser accuracy of the microphone?). Or, maybe, my acoustic guitar tuning mechanism just stinks because it's cheap. Either way, it will get you tuned up.The visual feedback is great--it'll light up green if you're in the right range, or red if you're off (flat or sharp). This sure beats tuning by ear."

                "text" : "Having friends and relatives who play both the guitar and the bass, people are always looking for a tuner to use to synchronize the chords on all their instruments. Using multiple tuners, one for each instrument, always produces a slightly different tone to each string from one instrument to another, and when you do a lot of performing, this can greatly throw off the entire sound of the group.Playing the electric drums, I personally have not had a lot of hands on experience with guitar tuners. Instead, my instrument of choice simply involves making sure that each drumhead has been programmed to the proper sound that I desire. However, I did know enough to know what I was looking for when I decided to purchase a tuner for one of my friends.This tuner has all of the features that I set out to find when purchasing a tuner. The line input is perfect for our bassist and guitarist to tune their instruments through a patch chord for the optimal sound. The ability to support six string basses and seven string guitars greatly helps when using drop tuning for heavier metal that relies on power chords performed in dropped scales rather than standard tuning.The display is easy to read, and allows for sufficient tuning. The pitch is displayed in a very easy to comprehend fashion, and it picks up even the slightest of sounds when tuning, making even tuning an electric guitar without a patch chord possible with relative ease. It comes with a fold out back that supports the unit as a fold away stand so as to allow the device to be placed on a table or hard surface while tuning.Overall, the compact design, sleek display, and ability to support both guitars and bass instruments allows this tuner to have enough versatility to warrant a purchase. It allows a band to ensure that both the guitarist and the bassist are tuned to the same pitch. It's perfect for drop tuning, and the line input and output truly help with the process of getting just the right sound out of each string."

I was used to playing Blues and Rock in the 1950-s and 1960's in the key of \"E\" and most three chord songs were in that key, while some drifted into a \"C\"..I got used to tuning in \"E\" and hearing it when it wasn't there, as it is the first top string on guitars, and Basses which gave me a fit, (the bass).I recall that many guys I played with always took like a good 1/2 hour pinching their keys and saying \"wait\"~!I would get a good \"E\" on the top then go down the strings remembering that the \"B\" string was flat 1/2 step, and got used to it.But, I always waited for these key - pinching fanatics, until I bought my first Bass, then I asked all for a Bass or low \"E\" chord then went from there..it was my system and was great for me, as the Bass \"E\" was nearly impossible to find all by yourself,(bass) there are no forks in the \"E\" (low) key.I bought my first KORG-30, and Korg-60 for my Mandolin and guitars and basses.I found most to be off including me!These Korgs will put you in the ballpark, then there are your \"key-pinchers\" always with an issue on tuning!Wasting time for practice and playing for audiences, this was always great enough, but, the Korgs and others I had bought were not in agreement, as others were flat, and Korgs even of the same Item # disagreed.This would be true even if all had tuned to an organ or Harmonica or pitch pipe, but the Korgs, even though not always agreeing w/ one another, would certainly disagree with other makes, so, if one is to complain about a few \"Mc-steps\" in pitch, be cool, as the ears are not going to pick up these micro-pitches that are picked up and disagreed with by other means.These are a great invention and puts you there, in spite of the fact that my Amp has a built in Bass Tuner, that I am always checking when I practice or play.So, I'd rather be off tune by less than a \"key pinch\" and use these Korgs or ANY good Name Tuner..Don't leave home w.o. it.Keep one in your pocket, your case, your amp. top, strapped across your forehead like a \"Samurai Warrier\" (With the letter \"E\" across the front center)!.It is the best we will have for a while, but we all will start on our bosses time schedule, and play w.o. the \"key-pincher's amp \"off\",when not in sight.~!~!~! (He/she will always disagree anyway).[...]"

This feature however is nice if you want to periodically check your tuning while playing. I am not a performer however if I was, this would be a nice feature.

If you don't care that much, or really don't plan on using it in-line, just go for the GA-30. If you want to use a lot of non-standard tuning, I suggest model CA-30 or CA-40, both of which are chromatic tuners. They can tune to any of the 12 pitches across any octave (so far as I can tell). They don't include presets for Guitar or Bass, though, so you need to know which notes to be tuning yourself.It is cheap enough for you to give it a try."

You can also use this to tune a 7 string guitar, a bass or acoustic guitars which is a plus because I own an electric and an acoustic guitar. It's also small and easy to carry around with you.The first time I used it on my guitars it took a little while because they were both very much out of tune but it was easy to get them in tune and now when I tune them it's easy and fast.I don't have any experience with other tuners but I do know that this is a good tuner with some good features at a cheap price and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a tuner."

So after doing quite a bit of homework (I'm a bit over the top about researching things I buy), I settled on this unit. Now that I've been using it for a couple of months, I can say without hesitation that it was a good purchase. To tune the guitar, you simply pick each string (EADGBE - Eddie Ate Dynamite Good-Bye Eddie) and watch the gauge. Tighten or loosen the stings until the needle lines up perfectly and the green \"all's well\" light comes on. Very easy to use and small enough to toss in a pocket. Definitely recommended.Written by Arthur Bradley, author of \"Process of Elimination\" - a cool erotic thriller that pits a martial artist against a world-class sniper out to shape the next Presidential election.As always, please be kind enough to indicate if reviews are helpful."

It has a handy fold out stand, for the money decent. But on the con side, it is unsteady, the needle on certain harmonics and notes will not stop and \"lock\" on the note, it will dance above and below what you seek, so you may have to \"ballpark it\" so to speak, which is okay, but again when setting intonation I don't want to \"ballpark\" anything. I have a cheap Quick Tune that does better in this regard, I ping a string, fretted or open and the needle goes to the pitch and holds steady, way better than this unit. Still, one must look at how much they didn't spend and factor that in. It's a decent tuner, for the money, and it has the output jack so the unit can be placed inline....I will keep it for that reason and upgrade for more steady accurate adjustments in terms of harmonics, and intonation."

Every time you pluck a string the tuner will tell you which note it is--it's good. But I need to mute the string and wait for the signal in the tuner to go away before I pluck the string again--I believe this is because the tuner picks up \"left-over\" tones from the previous pluck. In other words if you keep plucking the same string as you tune you are not going to get accurate tuning. I might not be using the tuner incorrectly. But I have tried quite a few times and only this method will give the best tuning result."

I travelled extensively doing concerts, that is, until I developed a heel spur. But, that is another matter entirely. Yes. I played out in so many honky tonks and 2 bit taverns west of the Mississppi, that I can't even remember them all. Sometimes things got out of hand. Why, I even have scars from when that mechanical bull gouged me in the back long ago. But I eventually realized this crazy, bus-trip-a-day life was affecting my spiritual powers. That's when I stopped.However, I still wrote songs. In fact, I was so good that many producers from Nashville kept calling me on the phone begging me for new material. The pressure was so overwhelming that I had to hire an answering service. The benefits exceeded the cost, just by a guitar string, so at least I was satisfied. I have written many hits. Here are just a few you may have heard:\"D-I-V-O-R-C-E-D-A-G-A-I-N\"\"(You Were) Always On My Tab\"\"The Night They Drove Ol' Metamorpho Down\"\"Stand By Your Fan\" (a summertime song)\"Seering After Midnight\"\"Mommas Don't Let Your Babys Grow Up to Be Car Thieves\"\"A Lawyer Named Sue\"...........................................and many, many more.Anyway, the point is, that to write these incisive songs, one must always have their instrument in tune. Since I play the guitar, this handy dandy little item is essential to seasoned professionals (like me) and newcomers alike. Yes. Korg makes a quality product here that will help you on your road to success. This little gadget is remarkable in providing you with quick, accurate tones as reference points so you will sound brilliant on stage. You see, it has a built in microphone which picks up the tone of a string when you pluck it. Then a meter screen in the middle will show you whether the tone is sharp of flat. There are little indicator lights above that will alert you to what needs adjusting. Now, the object of this small video game is to get that little needle pointing to the center green light, and then you will know that the string is accurately tuned.Now, this item does a lot more like support dropped tunings and tune 7 string guitars and 6 string basses. But I don't use these functions. No. I have a tough enough time just dealing with 6. I like the automatic shut off function. Sometimes I am so busy writing a new tune that I forget to turn it off. Too bad they didn't have that function on my gas stove the time I accidently burnt the ceiling. I also want to state that some reviewers here had trouble with battery power. Your Metamorpho has had this for 9 years now, and it's still going. In all, I think this product is well worth the investment. If you want to succeed at getting that elusive recording contract and want to be as successful as me, I do think this item will help you on your way. No sense going down the road feeling bad. Get one today!Now, let me get back to those 15 calls from Nashville....I Talk the Line -------- Metamorpho ;)"

It is so easy to use that I can perfectly tune the guitar within just a couple of minutes (good for me, who stood in awe of the salesman who tuned it by ear in less than 30 seconds). I taught my daughter how to use it, and she can also tune the guitar in just a couple of minutes. She loves to have her younger sister tighten/loosen the strings just so she can practice re-tuning it. This is a very good product for tuning a guitar in a quiet environment; it would not be so useful in an area which had loud noises present."

The mic has a rough time with background noise - so if you want to play acoustic at a small show or something- this might not be the one. But if you are like me (dink around at home mostly), this thing is great and a very inexpensive price compared to my old Boss TU."

I personally play exclusively in Standard for my electric playing, but sometimes I want to fiddle around with open-tunings on an acoustic. This piece-of-junk makes it incredibly difficult to tune to any tuning using \"F\" or \"C\" notes. I have no clue as to why that is, pretty stupid if you ask me, especially once you consider that majority of this generations guitarists are metal heads playing in drop c tuning or acoustic d-bags (I say that with love) that play in open tunings. Trust me, your money is best spent elsewhere."

It starts getting heavy when your collection starts growing. DO NOT FREAK OUT, but when you open it, at the other end, you see the material pushing foward, at first you start thinking that maybe you received a defected item, but then i realized, that the intentions are to keep your vinyls standing up str8. if you less records, make sure you get some paper for the empty space. remember your record must be standing up str8 otherwise they will become warped. and you dont want that. The strap on of the bag has a great little cushion in the middle for shoulder support. So this instantly registered with me, that once i fill this bag up, it will be heavy. This bag is very big and it will be touching and rubbing with your leggs as you walk like it or not."

The pitch is almost perfect and the sound board makes up for any slight lack in pitch. I find it easy to play, but that might not be the case for everyone. I play the piano, violin, cello, guitar - well I play several instruments well. I wanted something for fun, and the autoharp is just the ticket.I bought a book for the autoharp and have learned all the strums, chord combinations and picking from that book. I'm ready to order the second level book, which I will do through Amazon.com.The autoharp is a great instrument to accompany a singer, being much easier to learn to play than the piano or guitar. I would always recommend a 21-chord autoharp because of the many chords lacking in a 15-chord one...obviously. But, still, I have had students who bought a 15-chord autoharp and were disappointed after a few weeks of playing. Those 6 missing chords are vital to the sound and the playing.For anyone who wants to play the autoharp for fun or professionally, The Oscar Schmidt 21-chord is the best all-around instrument. I highly recommend it."

A screw was twisted off, allowing the chord bars to drop onto the strings. Two chord bars were severely warped, which made excessive pressure necessary in order to damp the unwanted notes in the chords. This was not shipping damage, as the unit was very well packed. Thanks to the diligence of the retailer, OS sent replacement parts which I installed. If you buy an Oscar Schmidt instrument, I recommend that you check it out thoroughly before leaving the store."

I took excellent care of these lights and only moved them about 12 times total (always using original boxes/packaging). Two of my fixtures have rows of LED's that are not working, probably the result of poor solder points, not LED's that have burned out (they had not been moved for months when the LED's went out so they were not damaged from moving them, they just quit working and they have only been used for a TINY fraction (about 1000 hours)of their advertised LED life). I have since purchased several other par 64 LED fixtures (which are Red Green Blue and White) which perform better as far as light output and the white LED's are a great addition. I chose the ADJ fixtures expecting better reliability but it ends up the cheaper knockoff brand lights I got are apparently built as well and cost me less than half as much.

I have to say, I'm very impressed with the quality of sound from this little bugger. I can't say how it compares to the $500+ rigs because I won't pay that much if I don't have to. But this rig does the job. I hooked the receiver up to my camera's mic input port (using a mini-plug step-down adapter -- the cord uses the larger size) and it'll send a signal through a wall with no distortion. One thing: you have to plug in the receiver to an outlet, so if you want to do dolly shots or hand held camera moves, it could be a little tricky. But since it runs on DC, I'm looking into rigging it up to a battery pack so I can be more mobile. The microphone is super sensitive, and the little foam cap needs to be held on with a rubber band if you plan to hide it beneath an actor's clothing. Other than that, this is a solid unit at a great price. I'd definitely buy another product from Gemini."

I actually use the \"main mix\" output on the back to go into a set of headphones, so there are no wires at all coming from the front. This configuration works well for me.Unlike cheaper models, this is a true stereo mixer - the L & R channels are kept separate, rather than mixed into a single mono channel that's sent to the L & R jacks for output. I should also note that the model I received is black with white labels, rather than beige with black labels, as pictured.Although this is one of the more expensive units out there, the sound quality is excellent, and because it's powered, there's no lack of volume. Highly recommended."

Beyond that there's not much to say because the device is very low on features that would give me something to say. It is important to note that the level controls are very crowded together and difficult to adjust without inadvertently turning the knob next to it. Another nit is the volume level at output. I switched to this mixer from a more sophisticated live audio mixer and the difference in maximum level was significant. I would expect that from a passive unit, but I shopped for an active mixer for that very reason - active mixers typically provide a higher output levels. This is more of a surprise than a drawback because I don't typically listen at maximum volumes. The only other issue is the 1960s design of it; one would think pride alone would motivate some style in the execution. Bottom line: happy I bought it and it is doing the job wonderfully.

The stand assembled easily, but it is not nearly as functional as the metal Manhasset stands and their clones. My chief problem with it is that the stand will not support a book (e.g., a Dover edition of Bach cantatas, or other such heavier scores from which I conduct. I have not yet found the right \"fix\" for this, but I'm sure it exists. If you are an instrumentalist who is not likely to have more than a 20-page part on this stand, it really does look nice in the music room.

Sometimes as you're adjusting it the stand will tilt causing music to fall off."

And I'm still in love with it. Have recently used it for international recording artists Vicki YoheI Just Want You, Alvin SlaughterOvercomerand others. I'm a college graduate with degrees in Music and other areas. You cannot go wrong with this investment, GET YOURS TODAY! This will make the distinction between Professional and Amateur. I also recommend you sing withShure SLX24/Beta87A Handheld Wireless System, J3, Vicki Yohe & Alvin Slaughter loves this mic. Matter fact, it's Alvin's personal choice wireless microphone system. Or you can go withShure SLX24/Beta58 Handheld Wireless System, H5. Get those two (effects process and wireless mic system) and you will be on your way to the top... TIP: When singing at a function/gig, don't allow people to use your equipment, if you do, they're liable to break your stuff....or charge them $50!"

From the Kevlar WhiteMax to the oil-filled pinstripes you can always find something in your size, tone, and price range. This is one of my favorite sets when paired with tone rings, and then I tune them until I can get a nice soft yet punchy attack, with a beautiful warm decay (I'll tune down my bottom head to heighten the effect). Very versatile when covering multiple genres. Now, on to the coated snare head.I personally love the simplicity of a coated Powerstroke-3. I love how they are built to minimize overtones, and I find them very responsive at all stick heights. Most likely what your school snares have on them, though the coating has long since been beaten off from years of use. I wonder if anyone has thought to use Amazon reviews as a blog - aside from me thinking about it right now..."

I've always been switching around from Evans clear 2ply heads, remo clear pinstripe 2plys, and Evans coated (white) 2ply heads.whenever I'd be at a music store playing a dw or pacific kit I'd fall in love with the heads that had the dampening ring built into them. And I could never get the right tone with all my other heads, I consider myself rather good at tuning kits.So I found these aquarian heads, sure you could just buy the dw heads but they're overpriced because it says dw on the package. Got a 10,12, and 14\" head for my toms, tuned them up and they sounded perfect!Now I play in a band and I play percussion and I let the drummer use my kit because its much nicer than his. The gigs sound great, just need to keep up on tuning."
