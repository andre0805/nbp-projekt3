I don't use a ton of pedals, but I use enough that it won't fit on a lot of the smaller boards.4) I know that my pedals are protected from damage with the hard shell case!Some improvements to think about!This board is almost identical to the Furman SPB-8C Stereo Pedalboard (which is no longer available new). What I liked about the Furman was that it had a pull up handle and wheels.I wonder why SKB didn't include this in the PS45?Overall, I love my PS45 pedalboard!

I was however really disappointed when I plugged it in and had no power. Luckily I have some technical skills and upon opening the powerbar discovered that the hot wire had come loose from its connector. With a crimping tool I re-connected the loose wire and it works fine. This was not something the vendor would know about a product in a sealed package, but it was not picked up on by the manufacturer. Makes you wonder if quality assurance was doing their job. Most folks would not have the courage to open something and would most likely have sent it back. A small fix but it got us off to a rocky start."

It's meant for people who either want a little bit of everything or do crazy things like have multiple loopers and delays set up. If you don't have enough to almost fill the board, I wouldn't recommend it, as there are options that aren't as heavy or bulky.As far as sound goes, it sounds great. I don't get noise from the power supply. Unless there's a noisy outlet or ambient interference, it' silent.And it's durable. I would still take care to not drop it, but if something is sitting on it or knocks into it, your pedals will be fine.The negatives? Sure, you can count it's weight and bulk as \"negative,\" but I won't - those things come with big rigs. What I don't like are 2 things:First, you can't close the lid with any wall warts plugged in. Second, it doesn't have a power switch.However, some interesting things to note:You stand pedals on end (if you're running out of room) thanks to lots of depth to the board. I've got a BBE Sonic Stomp that's upright, since it's always on. This extra headroom also allows you to store cables and miscellaneous gear on top of your pedals. And this is also enough room to stack pedals. I've got a tube screamer that I've got stacked on top of a pre-amp to make more room and it works great.Really, this ought to at least have a power switch. That bumped this to 4 stars. Perfection is just around the corner."

It is a little heavy and bulky, but it's a lot nicer than throwing all your pedals and adaptes in a bag and setting them up and breaking them down every show/practice. Also, if you use batteries, this will save you money! After my adapters broke (cheap boss cord), I used batteries for months. This will eliminate that, and in a way pay for itself! If you're looking at this, you probably need one, and there's nothing else in this price range that's nearly as good."

I love the 3 power outlets, I have 2 pedals that I have to plug in and the 3rd outlet is for my stage fan. There is plenty of room inside the case when it is closed for all my cables. I keep 2 mic cables, 2 guitar cables, and the power cord all wrapped up in there. The power cable is great too. It is nice and long. I almost never have to use an extension cord. I ran all the pedals together with George L. cables. This keeps everything looking neat with no \"spaghetti\" mess.George L's Effects Kit (Black Cable, Nickle Right Angle Plugs)I highly recommend this board to anyone who is serious about their pedals.

Furman power strip is great too offering both protection and as many plugins as you'll need for the pedal space provided. The only reason I would upgrade from this pedal board would be if I run out of pedal space. Even then not all is lost, as the furman strip detaches from the skb case.

On top of all this, you'd think that the power supply would be adequate right? Nope. With only 4 9V pedals plugged in, I found my EH Cathedral unit to start dropping out from being underpowered. I switched to a pedaltrain board and a Godlyke power supply, and I am 100% happier. Too bad I wasted money and time on this piece of junk."

It has a great hardshell cover but it takes up a massive amount of floor space, which is inconvenient for us as our practice space is the typical size (small) and there are five of us. The way the power cord is designed, people are constantly stepping on it and unplugging it while attempting to cross the room to get to the beer fridge. It also takes up a massive amount of space on stage, as well, about the same amount of room as another person would take.This thing will hold a ton of pedals, and maybe one day he'll have enough to fill it, and maybe one day we'll have a set where it's necessary to have all of his pedals with him at once.So just a heads up, this thing is big and heavy, as big and heavy as having another instrument. If you have a LOT of pedals that you use all the time, however, and have a lot of room in your practice space and on stage, this is a great pedal board."

I really like how smooth the beveled edge feels compared to the usual delrin or plastic picks, but they're a little bowl-shaped, so I'm having to go back and flatten them out myself (which I am not enjoying), and I don't like how one side is beveled while the other is not- this means I'm getting more of a scrape-pluck-scrape-pluck sound when I'm using alternating picking. I'm going to see if I can get my dad's help to make them really flat, a little more pointed and beveled on both sides. (He's a machinist.) I would recommend anyone buying them to consider doing the exact same thing (though, to be perfectly honest, you shouldn't have to go to this trouble at all). Again, they're good picks, and maybe I just got a lemon (which I'll have no trouble fixing, really), but if the rest of the picks coming from Ice Pix's manufacturer are the same as mine they'll need to be modified in order for you to get the full benefit, so don't fret. (Pardon the pun.) Now while you could, if you wanted, go and buy a 351 or jazz pick punch for about $25 ([...]), and get plastic sheets, in varying thicknesses, designed specifically for being punched into guitar picks ([...]), they're plastic, NOT metal, which has a completely different feel and sound! Anyway, try these metal picks out! They'll last you a lifetime and then some! I've heard some neat things about their brass picks, too, so maybe I'll those out a little further down the line."

They are also extremely sturdy, and a pack of three is plenty to last you a while. The only problem, is that they can't produce a wide variety of sound. Their lack of versatility will come back to haunt you when you want to use different picking techniques to add some flavor to whatever it is your playing.

But my real complaint is quality. As a former sheet metal punch press programmer these are my observations. Small parts \"oil-can\" when created with a single punch operation. These are \"oil-canned\" and not flat. No attempt was made to flatten them out. They are bowl shaped and the edges are square. Not beveled like the picture. I read another complaint before about this and it is true. For the cost I expected some quality. These picks literally cost about a penny a piece to manufacture \"as-sold\". You know how a machine gun sounds on auto-fire? That's how fast a CNC spits out parts like these."

There are the marks from it being on a crash stand and also scratches on the crash and some discoloring on the back. I felt like I had been a little deceived and am disappointed in Amazon. I know these crashes usually go for a long time but I would still like to have the comfort to know it is a new crash. I need it for a performance I am playing in 2 weeks, so I don't have time to return it but I hope that this is an exception and unintentional."

And since I'm the guy who loves little knobs and versatility, I went for the dime...Costed a little more than one though, but it's all worth it.It's really easy to understand what all the knobs do, and it helps the wah-rookie to get into the groove. Starting with a very moderate setting, your foot can't do much wrong, and you won't get the feeling that you can't get a decent tone out of it.And after surpisingly little time you're the master!I play around with the settings a lot, and I wouldn't want tot miss it for the world!

I've used many different types of picks over the years and I've not found the ideal one for me until recently when I decided to use a SilverPick which is basically a standard triangle thin design but made of silver which I find fits my needs the best and so far it's just a case of getting used to it.This particular Dunlop pick is as described being fat, stubby and sturdy with a nice grippable centre however if you are the kind of lead guitarist who uses a lot of pinch harmonics this pick will be difficult for you as the maximum grip and most comfortable holding position exposes a lot of the pick face. The hardness will make it good for fast playing but the thickness also makes it difficult to get a firm grip and accuracy of string picking too. For those who play bass ala Paul McCartney style though will find this pick excellently suited for them. For me though, I'll keep this among my collection of picks for use but it's not my default or preferred choice for play."

At my local guitar store there was a Baden guitar with a clear pick guard that was almost invisible - I didn't even realize it had a pick guard until someone pointed it out to me. So, I raced home and ordered this clear pick-guard.I had no trouble removing the existing pick guard, and installation of this new, clear guard was very simple. Unfortunately, as soon as I had attached it I realized that, unlike the clear pick guard I had (not) seen in the store, this one was glossy. As a result, it was really easy to tell that there was a clear pick-guard on the guitar, which defeats the entire purpose. It ended up looking like I had just put a big piece of tape under the soundhole, which was really tacky looking. Maybe it would have looked better if my guitar was glossy, but on my satin finish it just looked awful.So, I decided to remove this pick-guard, only to discover that it was much more difficult to remove than the original guard. It took a lot more heat to get this one off (I used a hair-dryer) and the glue was a lot harder to remove as well.Overall I would not recommend this product.Also, be aware that if you are removing an existing pick-guard there will be a \"tan line\" even on a relatively new guitar. I'm hoping that mine will fade but had I known all of the trouble that this process would cause me I would have just lived with the original guard."

I play Flamenco and I didn't want to leave my nail's mark on the guitar since flamenco play has too much tapping on the guitar. This pickguard is not the best quality but fair for the money and it does the job. The main advantage of it is that it does not change the tapping sound very much unlike some other thick pickguards in the market. It's almost invisible on the guitar if you apply it well without air bubble. You need to be very careful pasting it though because if you don't adjust it well, you can't take it off, the glue is very strong. You need to start from one end and gradually lean it to the other end.I've played a lot on it and it seems that it protects the board pretty well. It looks like a once forever kind of sticker though that once you applied, you're gonna have to leave it there because it doesn't come off easy (I've not tried but it's obvious)."

I want the stand bent over with the mic pointing to the side, so the arm is parallel to the face of the amp and the stand is out of the way. I've had a couple other stands (not sure where they are - I seem to have lost them in a move) and one thing I didn't think about when I ordered this one was what direction the mic would be pointing based on how the mic holder screws on. When I tightened the mic holder on, it was pointing the right direction for its intended use - sitting in front of someone with the mic pointing straight forward. I'm not sure if that was just coincidence or if the thread orientation is somehow standardized. Anyway, to get the mic pointing to the side, I had to really tighten it down, a little more than I was comfortable with. On a true boom mic stand with an adjustable length arm, you just put the mic holder on however tight you want it and then just rotate the boom when you adjust the length/position. That's not an option on is stand.Aside from that, it seems okay. It's compact, the base is heavy and the \"quik release\" adjustment isn't quicker than a traditional joint but it seems secure. But if I could do it again, I would try the Samson MB1 stand instead."

At one gig where we were playing loud in an enclosed area, this windscreen seemed to increase feedback - my suspicion was that the extra coverage on the rear was interfering with the cardioid pattern of the mic, allowing more bleed, because when I removed it the feedback less of an issue.The large size and coverage of this windscreen has also worked well as a protective dust cover for mics that I left out in the studio for longer periods of time.Pros:- Not very dense of a foam so it does not muffle the sound as much as the \"Tour Grade ...\".- Lasts a ridiculously long time.- Tough resilient foam.- Large enough to fit easily over any hand held microphone.Cons:- Large size means it is not a very snug fit. It never fell off, but then again if I swung it around on stage, seems like it would.- The tube-like shape doesn't look as good because of the deeper fitting windscreen that covers more of the mic, the \"Ball Style\" is definitely more striking in my opinion.- Has a deeper fit over the mic therefore it may interfere with the cardioid pattern of the mic.Summary. Not cute looking and potentially interferes with mic cardioid pattern, but long lasting, versatile and less muffled. Very good but not great."

I picked up a couple real cheap (elsewhere), one natural blonde and the other black.I bought them for house decoration with no illusion about getting any good sounds out of them. For house decoration purpose, they are fine. From a distance they look quite nice on a living room wall.Tuning them up was problematic. You must move the small wooden bridge to get the scale to match up to the fret markings. I found that about equadistant from the bottom of the soundhole to the bottom of the guitar was about right.As happens with many new stringed instruments, strings are not likely to stay tuned in the first hour or two after tuning. You might as well just get close and wait a couple of hours before any more fine tuning. After the wait, the guitars both stayed in tune fairly well.The lacquer was slightly sloppy on the black one I bought and very sloppy on the natural one. After getting everything tuned reasonably well, I found the black one made some partially good sound. The natural one was just audibly hopeless.Because of the low quality build you must play more precisely to get a good sound - maybe that's a good thing for casual practicing. These cheap guitars are a little louder than I expected and on the black one I could close-mike it about 9 inches from the sound hole with a Shure SM57 and actually get some useful, recordable sounds. To my surprise, because there is no bass to speak of, you can get a bright, jangly and very present sound that may prove useful in some recording mixes (black one only.)Bottom line: good for decoration or a cheap present for your kids and if you're really lucky you might find one that makes some useful sounds."

It seems like no matter where I put my rack components, they will never line up with the brackets correctly. I have to leave at least one space between each, meaning I will have to purchase another rack if I decide to use any more side-mounted components. Seems odd that every piece is either 1U or 2U but will not fit positioned directly underneath each other, but WILL fit in the same position.. if you can understand what I'm trying to say. I bought this because I needed 5U on the side. I will have to reposition my power conditioner into a top space so that I can insert my crossover. My 2U amp just does not fit. I have it sitting on the bottom spaces with only the top screw holes mounted in place, the bottom screws are fitted UNDER the mounting holes, and just barely grab the bottom edge of the faceplate on the amp. But this was intended to be a temporary fix to protect my new stuff and it will suffice until I need an upgrade."

My neighbor returned the package to me . Ok so the playing of the cornet with the new Blessing mouthpiece has been going very well compared to myBach cornet mouthpieces which I have several sizes,I don't know for sure why but it could be the rim size of the Blessing 3 is larger than my Bachs like a Bach 7C original mouthpiece with the cornet,and a Bach 5C. I believe a wider rim is the way to go for me ,but time will tell. Playing points,slurs are excellent and smooth with the Blessing 3C,going from low to high notes is smoother and comfortable,and finally the tone is fuller due to the larger rim size and the moderate cup depth C. At the price of the Blessing which is about half of the usual Bach price. All things together I would highly advise get a Blessing mouthpiece for your cornet,trumpet or flugelhorn(very nice flugel mouthpiece)Just one other point I notice the Bach mouthpieces at the shank have no bevel and on the Blessing as well as the Jet Tone mouthpieces have a smooth bevel at the shank end which iis there for a reason,and I believe it helps the airstream move smoothly thru the receiver of the trumpet or cornet. The somewhat rough edge of the shank of the Bach mouthpiece may not seem important,but then why do other mouthpiece makers take care and make sure the end of the shank is nicely beveled? I am not an expert by any means ,this is something I have noticed and not seen or heard from trumpet players about this facet of the mouthpiece. I do know the mouthpieces with the bevel shank seem to play very well."

Meganne is now the proud owner of a powder pink Pixie acoustic. The reduced girth of the neck is perfect for a girl's hand.

It works a lot better than the cork grease that comes in a stick. It lasts longer than the other kind as well, so there is fewer times that you have to re-apply it. I suppose the only downside is that I take off whatever is on the cork and joint before re-applying it so that there is not a lot of build up.Regardless I've used this on several different clarinets, including a bass clarinet when the metal neck was really stiff. It slid in perfectly after a few dabs, so it's good for more than just corks, although I suppose it's because this can also be used on brass instruments as well.I'm so glad that I found out where to buy more! I haven't been able to find this in store at all."

It does do a good job coating slides, particularly the tuning slide. I have used valve oil to thin the grease on my first and third valve slides. Personally, I do prefer using Hetman products as they work much better, are easier to use, and last just as long."

For example I use the ghost like effect to turn everyone passing or dancing in front of the camera into ghostlike images and change the back ground room color to bright fusia. If it come down to it and someone feels like a being a real life DJ they could get on the PC and remix with cross fades and real-time effects like distortion/reverb/echo/compression. It's fun. Difficulty level isn't bad at all, if you understand the concept of remixing samples in songs. If you enjoy music and want to add a little something special to your entertainment system...this is it. :)"

I guess that was just all bells and whistles because once I downloaded the program I was never able to get my songs from my hard drive to the playlist. I tried to check out the remix section of the program and it kept shutting down the system and told me that the program was not responding. Also, once you download the program it tells you to change the resolution of your system. I dont want to have to change my computer resolution everytime I plan on running this program, it messes up all of my desktop settings. The program is just too confusing and I plan to go back to my Musicmatch jukebox program which I have NEVER had a single problem with. I guess I was just fooled by thinking I could get something extra for the same amount of money. I guess that goes to show you that things are not as good as they always seem and if you have something that you are satisfied with you had better stick with it. As a final note, Musicmatch jukebox AUTOMATICALLY transfers my recent and new music files to run on its playlist."

Musician's Friend.com has it for about $70 cheaper last time I checked. It would still be worth Amazon's price, however due to it's great function.

Having owned a Korg in the past, I was partial to Korg, but we tested several Korgs, Casios, and Yamahas to compare. This WK3200AD was a definite winner with us. Although the comparable Yamaha and Korg had a bit more volume (greater speaker wattage), this Casio had them beat with its sound quality, numerous tones, accompaniment, and effects. The 76 keys allow for one to perform Classical pieces, which is a big plus in our house. Although my son is too young for the MIDI, mixer function, and drawboard, I am sure this keyboard will still be with him when he is older. Fantastic buy!"

If there's a way to make this work on XP, the Magix web site offers no help at all, and neither do the UseNet archives I've searched. The date on the CD is 1999; so most likely support is no longer available anyway.Software that won't let you install on an unsupported platform is scandalous, in my professional opinion. You pay for it, you should be able to use it - even if that means waiving support. Hopefully, newer products are limited only by the terms of their end-user licensing agreements.On the other hand, the bundled MIDI cable alone, if it works with other software, will have justified the low price I paid. :-) An identical cable at the local music store would have cost me a lot more."

It works best close up however recoding concerts from the audience is also good if you watch your levels and adjust them accordingly. I get many compliments about my recordings. I use it with a Sharp MD recorder and also bought one for a Roland Micro Digital recorder. It comes with a holder/stand which also can attach to a floor microphone stand if you find the right thread which I never have. That might be the only negative.

Also, the body of the mic has a somewhat oblong shape instead of being perfectly round. As such, you'll have a hard time finding any standard mic holder to attach this microphone to a stand.The solution is to go to Radio Shack and get their spring-clip style microphone holder. I think it cost me about $6, if that. It has standard threads to attach to a stand, and the sides of the holder have foam padding where they contact the mic, to give a good grip.Of course, the holder is designed to act as its own \"stand\" if you want to set it on a table or desktop while recording. However, the mic can easily fall over if the table/desk is bumped or if the cord gets tugged inadvertently.Otherwise, the mic has a nice, solid feel and appears to be well-constructed."

I use it with my minidisc recorder when I need to record my live performances. I've found that the best way to use this is to set it on the floor between my feet, using a low profile microphone stand from Musician's Friend. Low profile is the name they give it. While you're ordering, get their spring clip microphone holder to hold this microphone. For my best results, extend the low profile stand all the way, clip in the microphone, and face it away from you. Now point it straight up, and you'll get a nice recording of your singing and playing, while capturing the ambience of the room. This setup doesn't overpower the microphone, thus it doesn't engage the limiter to chop down the sound. If you use the setup I've detailed, you'll get a nice recording, and if you need to hear how this sounds, go to www.CDBaby.com, type in Lori McKenna, and listen to the samples of the Kitchen tapes in high-fi, and you'll hear how good this microphone sounds."

The unit is built well, and comes apart easily to allow replacement of the battery, which should last a long time.

MD is the best though.Here's one MD player recorder that I know has the microphone jack and works great with this microphone:'Sony MZ-NF810CK Net MD MiniDisc Recorder with Car Kit'However, don't be fooled. Not every MD player has the appropriate Mic Jack. Double Check the technical documentation to make sure. Units that definitely do not have it are:'Sony MZ-NE410 High Speed Net MD Walkman Recorder'Notice the deceptive &quot;Recorder&quot; moniker in the product name. Don't be fooled! Very few MD &quot;recorders&quot; actually record with a microphone!Not sure about these:'Sony MZ-NF610 High Speed Net MD Walkman Recorder''Sony MZ-N510CK NetMD Walkman/Recorder with Car Kit''Sony MZ-N505 Net MD Walkman Player/Recorder'Do your research before purchasing any MD player. All in all, this is a good value and pretty good quality for a digital microphone."

It runs lovingly on one AA battery (unlike it's watch-battery-dependent predecessor) and allows for two polor patterns 180 and 90 degrees. The casing of the unit is rugged. It includes wind screen, travel pouch, stand clip, and four foot cloth encased cable. I have been able to record everything from street musicians to Dave Bruebeck concerts.In pro audio it isn't considerd cool to like Sony gear as it often uses digital tricks to achieve a bogus sense of higher fidelity, but Sony electronics are bulletproof and work exactly as designed until you lose them or back them over with your car. That said...Lots of people I have spoken with purchased this microphone thinking they could jack into the 1/8\" input on thier laptop computer and get desirable results. This might work if your microphone is inches away from a blaring guitar amp, but won't do well with amient recordings or speaking as the output gain is far too low. Most people are not happy in this situation.Overall, worth every penny. Perhaps there is a modification out there to improve the output gain."

I haven't triedit for vocals. Probably the real issue is the audio-inputjack on the laptop and perhaps the soundcard in the laptopas well. External audio interfaces run on Firewire and USB2.0and start at about $30. The argument is that laptop soundcardsunderperform in recording use because the card shares resourceswith the CPU. If you use a desktop you can plug a new soundcardinto a PCI slot, or use an external box. The argument foran external soundcard box with inputs/outputs on it flowsalong the notion that the fans in a PC are noisy so it's betterto have the soundcard outside.I agree with some of the other reviewer who say it has abit of a \"digital\" sound to it. Not a warm-sounding micbut nice to have and not expensive. Seems very durableand of course it's quite compact."

The sound quality is excellent, it fits in my camera bag, it has a long cord, and I am not going to cry too much if I drop it as it wasn't that pricey. My biggest complaints are that if you aren't conscious of what you are doing, you can get alot of mic handling noise - the build of the mic handle seems to really accentuate it. Also it has an on/off/90 degree and 360 degree switch and I often forget to turn it off and it drains the battery. Still, it's an excellent mic for the price and for someone starting out doing simple interviews and so on. To hear a sample of it, click on the slideshow here.

                "text" : "I have owned this mic for 7 or 8 years, and have used it many times in various applications. Overall, the sound quality is good and the 90 and mid-side options are useful. Of course it doesn't match the sound quality of a professional condenser mic, but for the money it is a fairly good value.I recently compared The SONY mic to the built-in stereo mics on my Panasonic GH2 camera, and the SONY mic sounds better (better signal to noise ratio, flatter frequency response, improved low frequencies, and the ability to position/focus the mic's position allows for better isolation of room noise). The 90 and mid-side options give you two options for stereo recording. The mid-side captures a wider stereo field and can be more natural sounding, albeit less focused and more prone to room noise/reverberation.The battery consumption is minimal, and the power light will flash red when you turn it on to indicate battery life is good. Just be aware that the power light does not stay on when the mic is on. Thus, you could easily leave it on and drain the battery.My only gripe with this item it the mic \"stand\" that comes with it will not attach to a conventional microphone stand, and its narrow base makes it prone to tipping over. I am a musician, and the SONY's mic stand hole diameter is nearly 3/4\" with very coarse threads. Conventional mic stands use 5/8\" diameter with a much finer thread. So, if I want to attach the ECM-MS907 to a conventional mic stand, I need to find an adapter of some sort. I have used generic microphone clips in lieu of the ECM-MS907's mic stand, but I'd like to find an adapter. As SONY also makes pro-audio gear, why they used this non-standard hole and thread configuration is baffling.BTW, the GH2 uses a non-standard 3/32\" input jack, thus requiring an adapter for the SONY's 1/8\" plug. C'mon, people, please stick with standards!!!The permanently attached cable is very thin and doesn't inspire confidence, BUT it hasn't failed me, yet. When it does, I hope I can dismantle the mic and repair it.All in all, its a good mic. There are so many condenser mics that have come onto the market since this was introduced, I would strongly consider looking at other options. However, if you can find one of these used, for cheap ($20-$30 or so), I'd say it would be a good alternative to your camera's built-in mics, or as a cheap backup mic."

You know how video cams get lousy audio because the mic is over with the camera and not out with the subjects? When this mic is out in front the length at its cord (5 ft), it provides great audio. When I add a 10ft extension, the mic loses quite a bit of its signal so that the audio level I get is about 60% of what it was with the shorter length cord. Still much better than if I use the mic on the camera. So maybe you will not try to use a longer cord - the main issue with the mic is that it would be nice if it produced a higher level of audio output so that you get a stronger signal into your recording device, but the sound it gets is nice and clear and it works well for amateur applications."

It looks funny for video applications... and 2. If I wasn't using for a video application, it just felt wierd to use it as it was. So this mic is just perfect. And the carrying bag that comes with it is extra large so... I can fit my MD recorder, a few accessories, the spring-loaded mic holder for my stand, and the microphone itself inside like a glove. I call it my \"mini-studio in a bag\".And for reference the MD Recorder I am using is a HI-MD SONY MZ-M100."

For this microphone that situation is when you're sitting around with a few friends and trading songs and stories. I bought one because a friend of mine had one and had it paired up with a minidisc player. I mainly use it plugged into a laptop with an external soundcard or directly into a mixing board.It picks up sound from a small or mid sized room nicely for acoustic performances. The stereo separation is nice, not too much and not too little. The fidelity is amazing for the price. As another reviewer pointed out, this microphone was used to record Lori McKenna's albumThe Kitchen Tapeswhich is very impressive in my book.If you're looking for a microphone for podcasting where you need to cheaply and easily pick up multiple voices around a table this would probably work well also.If you're doing podcasting or vocal work where everyone would have a separate microphone then you'll probably want to look elsewhere."

It picked up conversations in a large conference room during a presentation. I just set it up on the front table pointing at the presenter and got good quality sound.I was amazed that it picked up relatively quiet conversations from very far away. All that was necessary was to turn up the volume when I play back. So I will be able to normalize this with audio software.Another interesting thing, there were times during break when two interesting conversations were going on at different sides of the microphone. I was able to isolate them both and present them as two different recordings, since the stereo seperation was so complete.I look forward to further use. I especially want to use it to record sound for my digital videos, since the microphone on the video camera itself is not so good."

Used in conjunction with theSony MZ-R37 Portable Minidisc Player/Recorder, it's perfect for on-the-fly practice and performance sessions; no worries about recording levels or finding the perfect placement of the microphone--a challenge I could never overcome with analog systems. As an amateur acoustic musician who doesn't play or record that often, it's nice not to have to worry about the perfect setup. The microphone, with its two different stereo angle options, offers great flexibility. Your only concern will be blocking OUT sound, like birds in the background or the neighbor's dog, or children jumping on the bed. Worth every penny!"

                "summary" : "Useful mic priced lower than ever, but here are a few tips.",
                "text" : "This proven mic has come down in price, while the one below it--the Sony DS70--has remained pretty much the same. For the extra 15 bucks, the Sony MS907 is easily worth the upgrade. The only advantage of the DS70 is not having to worry about having a fresh battery installed. The MS907 sounds fuller and richer, but frankly I did not judge it to be superior to the overall effect of the 4-point microphone that comes with the popular Zoom H-2. Whether or not you choose to use it in place of the onboard mic of a high-end personal audio recorder really comes down to a matter of personal taste. On the other hand, if you've picked up the new Zoom H-4n, this Sony stereo mic would be an excellent choice for complementing the onboard ones since the new Zoom allows for use of onboard and external mics simultaneously.As for recording to a software audio program on an iMac, that particular computer has an audio input that will accommodate the 3.5mm plug (but be aware that many computers do not have such an input--in that case, look at a USB mic such as those from Blue). Even with the right fit and a fresh battery, I found the MS907 to be somewhat underpowered for optimal results. It wasn't until I plugged it into an Onkyo preamp that I was satisfied. Again, I suspect that a mic with a USB connector would permit better gain levels with most computers.There are adequate mic amps on Amazon for $20-$40, capable of boosting your signal by 48 volts, or 60 dbs. A Mac user willing to spend a bit more should look at the MXL Signal Booster Amp for Mac Computers, which costs a bit more but saves you the bother of USB conversion. Finally, if you're trying to make professional announcements for radio use, etc., you'll soon discover that, unless you're incapable of puckering (which means you're not much of a kisser), the plosives (\"p\" sounds) will run away with everything you try to say. The only solutions I've found are to write scripts that are devoid of plosives (the \"voiced\" \"b\" phoneme is almost as much of an offender as the voiceless \"p\" phoneme) or to pick up a \"pop filter.\" The latter are little more than 6\" circles of cheese cloth costing $20-$30 each, but I'm about to give in and order one from Amazon.The last advice I'll offer is not to indulge in candy or a sweet soda while broadcasting. It'll thicken your saliva and make you sound like someone attempting to communicate with his dentist after being shot up with novocaine (or is it lidocaine, these days?)--in any case, it's sugar cane, and fuctose syrup, that will muck up your elocution, making your gums talk louder than your words."
